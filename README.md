Use what you learn in the examples to write code in "GreetTheWorld" that will greet the user based on the time of day. Copy and paste each example to the programiz compiler and play around with it.

To test your code, copy and paste your code to https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/ Do not be discouraged! the best way to learn to code is by writing more code. Make changes and see what happens when you press "Run"
